# Arctic-Game

You live the life of a polar bear in the Arctic Ocean. You must travel from iceberg to iceberg, struggling to live. Fight different arctic animals in turn based combat. 

This is the code I wrote in the game, so if you want to use some of the code I wrote, go ahead. Don't forget to tag me!
